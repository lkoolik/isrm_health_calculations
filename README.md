## Purpose and Goals
The Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) is a powerful first step towards lowering key technical barriers by making simplifying assumptions that allow for streamlined predictions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations resulting from emissions-related policies or interventions.\[[*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176131)\] InMAP performance has been validated against observational data and WRF-Chem, and has been used to perform source attribution and exposure disparity analyses.\[[*](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abf4491), [*](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1816102116), [*](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1818859116)\] The InMAP Source-Receptor Matrix (ISRM) was developed by running the full InMAP model tens of thousands of times to understand how a unit perturbation of emissions from each grid cell affects concentrations across the grid. However, both InMAP and the ISRM require considerable computational and math proficiency to run and an understanding of various atmospheric science principles to interpret. Furthermore, estimating health impacts requires additional knowledge and calculations beyond InMAP. Thus, a need arises for a standalone and user-friendly process for comparing air quality health disparities associated with various climate change policy scenarios.

The ultimate goal of this repository is to create a pipeline for estimating disparities in health impacts associated with incremental changes in emissions. Annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are estimated using the [InMAP Source Receptor Matrix](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1816102116) for California.

## Methodology ##
The ISRM Health Calculation model works by a series of two modules. First, the model estimates annual average change in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations as part of the **Concentration Module**. Second, the excess mortality resulting from the concentration change is calculated in the **Health Module**.

### Concentration Module Methodology ###
The InMAP Source Receptor Matrix (ISRM) links emissions sources to changes in receptor concentrations. There is a matrix layer for each of the five precursor species: primary PM<sub>2.5</sub>, ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxides of sulfur (SOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). For each of these species, the ISRM matrix dimensions are: 3 elevations by 21,705 sources by 21,705 receptors. The three elevations of release height within the ISRM are:
* Less than 57 meters
* Between 57 and 140 meters
* Greater than 760 meters.

The units of each cell within the ISRM are micrograms per meter cubed per microgram per second, or concentration per emissions. 

The concentration module has the following steps. Details about the code handling each step are described in the Code Details([*](https://github.com/lkoolik/isrm_health_calculations/blob/main/README.md#code-details)) section below.

1. **Preprocessing**: the tool will load the emissions shapefile and perform a series of formatting checks and adjustments. Any updates will be reported through the command line. Additionally, the ISRM layers will be imported as an object. The tool will also identify how many of the ISRM layers are required for concentration calculations.

For each layer triggered in the preprocessing step: 

2. **Emissions Re-Allocation**: the tool will re-grid emissions to the ISRM grid.
   1. The emissions shape and the ISRM shape are intersected.
   2. Emissions for the intersection object are allocated from the original emissions shape by the percent of the original emissions area that is contained within the intersection.
   3. Emissions are summed by ISRM grid cell.
   4. Note: for point source emissions, a small buffer is added to each point to allocate to ISRM grid cells.
3. **Matrix Multiplication**: Once the emissions are re-gridded to the ISRM grid, they are multiplied by the ISRM grid level for the corresponding layer. 

Once all layers are done:

4. **Sum all Concentrations**: concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> are summed by ISRM grid cell.
